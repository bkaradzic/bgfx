Building
--------

### Prerequisites

Premake 4.4 beta4  
[http://industriousone.com/premake/download](http://industriousone.com/premake/download)

GNU make and CoreUtils  
Windows users download GNU utilities from:  
[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)  
[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm)

### Getting source

	git clone git://github.com/bkaradzic/bx.git
	git clone git://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx.git
	cd bgfx
	make

After calling `make`, .build/projects/* directory will be generated. All
intermediate files generated by compiler will be inside .build directory
structure. Deleting .build directory at any time is safe.

### Prerequisites for Android

Download AndroidNDK from:  
[https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html)

	setx ANDROID_NDK_ROOT <path to AndroidNDK directory>
	setx ANDROID_NDK_ARM <path to AndroidNDK directory>\toolchains\arm-linux-androideabi-4.7\prebuilt\windows-x86_64

### Prerequisites for Linux

	sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev

### Prerequisites for Native Client on Windows

Download Native Client SDK from:  
[https://developers.google.com/native-client/sdk/download](https://developers.google.com/native-client/sdk/download)

	setx NACL_SDK_ROOT <path to Native Client SDK directory>

### Prerequisites for Windows

When building on Windows, you have to set DXSDK_DIR environment variable to
point to DirectX SDK directory.

	setx DXSDK_DIR <path to DirectX SDK directory>

If you're building with Visual Studio 2008, you'll need TR1 support from:  
[Visual C++ 2008 Feature Pack Release](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6922)

If you're building with MinGW/TDM compiler on Windows make DirectX SDK
directory link to directory without spaces in the path.

	mklink /D c:\dxsdk <path to DirectX SDK directory>
	setx DXSDK_DIR c:\dxsdk

Apply this [patch](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bx/blob/master/include/compat/mingw/dxsdk.patch)
to DXSDK from June 2010 to be able to use it with MinGW/TDM.

### Building

Visual Studio 2008 command line:

	make vs2008-release64

Visual Studio 2008 IDE:

	start .build/projects/vs2008/bgfx.sln

Linux 64-bit:

	make linux-release64

Other platforms:

	make <configuration>

Configuration is `<platform>-<debug/release>[32/64]`. For example:

	linux-release32, nacl-debug64, nacl-arm-debug, pnacl-release, 
	android-release, etc.

Examples
--------

Most of the examples require shader/texture/mesh data to be loaded. When running
examples your current directory should be examples/runtime.

	<bgfx_path>/examples/runtime $ ../../.build/<config>/bin/example-00-helloworldDebug

Internals
---------

bgfx is using sort-based draw call bucketing. This means that submission order
doesn't necessarily match the rendering order, but on the low-level they
will be sorted and ordered correctly. On the high level this allows
more optimal way of submitting draw calls for all passes at one place, and on
the low-level this allows better optimization of rendering order. This sometimes
creates undesired results usually for GUI rendering, where draw order should
usually match submit order. bgfx provides way to enable sequential rendering for
these cases (see `bgfx::setViewSeq`).

Internally all low-level rendering draw calls are issued inside single function
`Context::rendererSubmit`. This function exist inside each renderer backend
implementation.

More detailed description of sort-based draw call bucketing can be found at:  
[Order your graphics draw calls around!](http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/?p=86)

Customization
-------------

By default each platform has sane default values. For example on Windows default
renderer is DirectX9, and on Linux it is OpenGL 2.1. On Windows platform all
rendering backends are available. For OpenGL ES on desktop you can find more 
information at:- 
[OpenGL ES 2.0 and EGL on desktop](http://www.g-truc.net/post-0457.html)  

If you're targeting specific mobile hardware, you can find GLES support in their
official SDKs:
[Adreno SDK](http://developer.qualcomm.com/mobile-development/mobile-technologies/gaming-graphics-optimization-adreno/tools-and-resources),
[Mali SDK](http://www.malideveloper.com/),
[PowerVR SDK](http://www.imgtec.com/powervr/insider/sdkdownloads/).

All configuration settings are located inside [src/config.h](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/blob/master/src/config.h).

Every `BGFX_CONFIG_*` setting can be changed by passing defines thru compiler
switches. For example setting preprocessor define `BGFX_CONFIG_RENDERER_OPENGL=1`
on Windows will change backend renderer to OpenGL 2.1. on Windows. Since
rendering APIs are platform specific, this obviously won't work nor make sense
in all cases. Certain platforms have only single choice, for example the Native
Client works only with OpenGL ES 2.0 renderer, using anything other than that
will result in build errors.

Tools
-----

### Shader Compiler (shaderc)

bgfx cross-platform shader language is based on GLSL syntax. It's uses ANSI C
preprocessor to transform GLSL like language syntax into HLSL. This technique
has certain drawbacks, but overall it's simple and allows quick authoring of
cross-platform shaders.

### Texture Compiler (texturec)

This tool doesn't currently exist. Use nvdxt, or any other tool that produces
DDS textures for now.

### Geometry Compiler (geometryc)

Converts Wavefront .obj mesh file to format optimal for using with bgfx.

Todo
----

 - Multiple render targets.
 - BlendFuncSeparate and BlendEquationSeparate.
 - Blit between textures.
 - Occlusion queries.
 - iOS support.
 - DX11: MSAA.
 - Fullscreen mode.
