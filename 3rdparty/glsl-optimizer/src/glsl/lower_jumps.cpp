/**
 * \file lower_jumps.cpp
 *
 * This pass lowers jumps (break, continue, and return) to if/else structures.
 *
 * It can be asked to:
 * 1. Pull jumps out of ifs where possible
 * 2. Remove all "continue"s, replacing them with an "execute flag"
 * 3. Replace all "break" with a single conditional one at the end of the loop
 * 4. Replace all "return"s with a single return at the end of the function,
 *    for the main function and/or other functions
 *
 * Applying this pass gives several benefits:
 * 1. All functions can be inlined.
 * 2. nv40 and other pre-DX10 chips without "continue" can be supported
 * 3. nv30 and other pre-DX10 chips with no control flow at all are better
 *    supported
 *
 * Continues are lowered by adding a per-loop "execute flag", initialized to
 * true, that when cleared inhibits all execution until the end of the loop.
 *
 * Breaks are lowered to continues, plus setting a "break flag" that is checked
 * at the end of the loop, and trigger the unique "break".
 *
 * Returns are lowered to breaks/continues, plus adding a "return flag" that
 * causes loops to break again out of their enclosing loops until all the
 * loops are exited: then the "execute flag" logic will ignore everything
 * until the end of the function.
 *
 * Note that "continue" and "return" can also be implemented by adding
 * a dummy loop and using break.
 * However, this is bad for hardware with limited nesting depth, and
 * prevents further optimization, and thus is not currently performed.

/**
 * Enum recording the result of analyzing how control flow might exit
 * an IR node.
 *
 * Each possible value of jump_strength indicates a strictly stronger
 * guarantee on control flow than the previous value.
 *
 * The ordering of strengths roughly reflects the way jumps are
 * lowered: jumps with higher strength tend to be lowered to jumps of
 * lower strength.  Accordingly, strength is used as a heuristic to
 * determine which lowering to perform first.
 *
 * This enum is also used by get_jump_strength() to categorize
 * instructions as either break, continue, return, or other.  When
 * used in this fashion, strength_always_clears_execute_flag is not
 * used.
 *
 * The control flow analysis made by this optimization pass makes two
 * simplifying assumptions:
 *
 * - It ignores discard instructions, since they are lowered by a
 *   separate pass (lower_discard.cpp).
 *
 * - It assumes it is always possible for control to flow from a loop
 *   to the instruction immediately following it.  Technically, this
 *   is not true (since all execution paths through the loop might
 *   jump back to the top, or return from the function).
 *
 * Both of these simplifying assumtions are safe, since they can never
 * cause reachable code to be incorrectly classified as unreachable;
 * they can only do the opposite.
