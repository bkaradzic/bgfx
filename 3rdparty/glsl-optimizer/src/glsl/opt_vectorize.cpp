/**
 * \file opt_vectorize.cpp
 *
 * Combines scalar assignments of the same expression (modulo swizzle) to
 * multiple channels of the same variable into a single vectorized expression
 * and assignment.
 *
 * Many generated shaders contain scalarized code. That is, they contain
 *
 * r1.x = log2(v0.x);
 * r1.y = log2(v0.y);
 * r1.z = log2(v0.z);
 *
 * rather than
 *
 * r1.xyz = log2(v0.xyz);
 *
 * We look for consecutive assignments of the same expression (modulo swizzle)
 * to each channel of the same variable.
 *
 * For instance, we want to convert these three scalar operations
 *
 * (assign (x) (var_ref r1) (expression float log2 (swiz x (var_ref v0))))
 * (assign (y) (var_ref r1) (expression float log2 (swiz y (var_ref v0))))
 * (assign (z) (var_ref r1) (expression float log2 (swiz z (var_ref v0))))
 *
 * into a single vector operation
 *
 * (assign (xyz) (var_ref r1) (expression vec3 log2 (swiz xyz (var_ref v0))))

/**
 * Rewrites the swizzles and types of a right-hand side of an assignment.
 *
 * From the example above, this function would be called (by visit_tree()) on
 * the nodes of the tree (expression float log2 (swiz z   (var_ref v0))),
 * rewriting it into     (expression vec3  log2 (swiz xyz (var_ref v0))).
 *
 * The function operates on ir_expressions (and its operands) and ir_swizzles.
 * For expressions it sets a new type and swizzles any non-expression and non-
 * swizzle scalar operands into appropriately sized vector arguments. For
 * example, if combining
 *
 * (assign (x) (var_ref r1) (expression float + (swiz x (var_ref v0) (var_ref v1))))
 * (assign (y) (var_ref r1) (expression float + (swiz y (var_ref v0) (var_ref v1))))
 *
 * where v1 is a scalar, rewrite_swizzle() would insert a swizzle on
 * (var_ref v1) such that the final result was
 *
 * (assign (xy) (var_ref r1) (expression vec2 + (swiz xy (var_ref v0))
 *                                              (swiz xx (var_ref v1))))
 *
 * For swizzles, it sets a new type, and if the variable being swizzled is a
 * vector it overwrites the swizzle mask with the ir_swizzle_mask passed as the
 * data parameter. If the swizzled variable is scalar, then the swizzle was
 * added by an earlier call to rewrite_swizzle() on an expression, so the
 * mask should not be modified.
