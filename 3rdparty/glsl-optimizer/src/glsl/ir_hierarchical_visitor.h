/**
 * Base class of hierarchical visitors of IR instruction trees
 *
 * Hierarchical visitors differ from traditional visitors in a couple of
 * important ways.  Rather than having a single \c visit method for each
 * subclass in the composite, there are three kinds of visit methods.
 * Leaf-node classes have a traditional \c visit method.  Internal-node
 * classes have a \c visit_enter method, which is invoked just before
 * processing child nodes, and a \c visit_leave method which is invoked just
 * after processing child nodes.
 *
 * In addition, each visit method and the \c accept methods in the composite
 * have a return value which guides the navigation.  Any of the visit methods
 * can choose to continue visiting the tree as normal (by returning \c
 * visit_continue), terminate visiting any further nodes immediately (by
 * returning \c visit_stop), or stop visiting sibling nodes (by returning \c
 * visit_continue_with_parent).
 *
 * These two changes combine to allow nagivation of children to be implemented
 * in the composite's \c accept method.  The \c accept method for a leaf-node
 * class will simply call the \c visit method, as usual, and pass its return
 * value on.  The \c accept method for internal-node classes will call the \c
 * visit_enter method, call the \c accpet method of each child node, and,
 * finally, call the \c visit_leave method.  If any of these return a value
 * other that \c visit_continue, the correct action must be taken.
 *
 * The final benefit is that the hierarchical visitor base class need not be
 * abstract.  Default implementations of every \c visit, \c visit_enter, and
 * \c visit_leave method can be provided.  By default each of these methods
 * simply returns \c visit_continue.  This allows a significant reduction in
 * derived class code.
 *
 * For more information about hierarchical visitors, see:
 *
 *    http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HierarchicalVisitorPattern
 *    http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HierarchicalVisitorDiscussion
