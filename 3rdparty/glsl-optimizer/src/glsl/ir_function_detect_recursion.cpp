/**
 * \file ir_function_detect_recursion.cpp
 * Determine whether a shader contains static recursion.
 *
 * Consider the (possibly disjoint) graph of function calls in a shader.  If a
 * program contains recursion, this graph will contain a cycle.  If a function
 * is part of a cycle, it will have a caller and it will have a callee (it
 * calls another function).
 *
 * To detect recursion, the function call graph is constructed.  The graph is
 * repeatedly reduced by removing any function that either has no callees
 * (leaf functions) or has no caller.  Eventually the only functions that
 * remain will be the functions in the cycles.
 *
 * The GLSL spec is a bit wishy-washy about recursion.
 *
 * From page 39 (page 45 of the PDF) of the GLSL 1.10 spec:
 *
 *     "Behavior is undefined if recursion is used. Recursion means having any
 *     function appearing more than once at any one time in the run-time stack
 *     of function calls. That is, a function may not call itself either
 *     directly or indirectly. Compilers may give diagnostic messages when
 *     this is detectable at compile time, but not all such cases can be
 *     detected at compile time."
 *
 * From page 79 (page 85 of the PDF):
 *
 *     "22) Should recursion be supported?
 *
 *      DISCUSSION: Probably not necessary, but another example of limiting
 *      the language based on how it would directly map to hardware. One
 *      thought is that recursion would benefit ray tracing shaders. On the
 *      other hand, many recursion operations can also be implemented with the
 *      user managing the recursion through arrays. RenderMan doesn't support
 *      recursion. This could be added at a later date, if it proved to be
 *      necessary.
 *
 *      RESOLVED on September 10, 2002: Implementations are not required to
 *      support recursion.
 *
 *      CLOSED on September 10, 2002."
 *
 * From page 79 (page 85 of the PDF):
 *
 *     "56) Is it an error for an implementation to support recursion if the
 *     specification says recursion is not supported?
 *
 *     ADDED on September 10, 2002.
 *
 *     DISCUSSION: This issues is related to Issue (22). If we say that
 *     recursion (or some other piece of functionality) is not supported, is
 *     it an error for an implementation to support it? Perhaps the
 *     specification should remain silent on these kind of things so that they
 *     could be gracefully added later as an extension or as part of the
 *     standard.
 *
 *     RESOLUTION: Languages, in general, have programs that are not
 *     well-formed in ways a compiler cannot detect. Portability is only
 *     ensured for well-formed programs. Detecting recursion is an example of
 *     this. The language will say a well-formed program may not recurse, but
 *     compilers are not forced to detect that recursion may happen.
 *
 *     CLOSED: November 29, 2002."
 *
 * In GLSL 1.10 the behavior of recursion is undefined.  Compilers don't have
 * to reject shaders (at compile-time or link-time) that contain recursion.
 * Instead they could work, or crash, or kill a kitten.
 *
 * From page 44 (page 50 of the PDF) of the GLSL 1.20 spec:
 *
 *     "Recursion is not allowed, not even statically. Static recursion is
 *     present if the static function call graph of the program contains
 *     cycles."
 *
 * This langauge clears things up a bit, but it still leaves a lot of
 * questions unanswered.
 *
 *     - Is the error generated at compile-time or link-time?
 *
 *     - Is it an error to have a recursive function that is never statically
 *       called by main or any function called directly or indirectly by main?
 *       Technically speaking, such a function is not in the "static function
 *       call graph of the program" at all.
 *
 * \bug
 * If a shader has multiple cycles, this algorithm may erroneously complain
 * about functions that aren't in any cycle, but are in the part of the call
 * tree that connects them.  For example, if the call graph consists of a
 * cycle between A and B, and a cycle between D and E, and B also calls C
 * which calls D, then this algorithm will report C as a function which "has
 * static recursion" even though it is not part of any cycle.
 *
 * A better algorithm for cycle detection that doesn't have this drawback can
 * be found here:
