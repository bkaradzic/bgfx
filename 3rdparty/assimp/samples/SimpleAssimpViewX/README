How to build:
-------------

  - compile Assimp as static library, copy the generated libassimp.a right here.
  - copy the Assimp headers from ./../../include to ./include
  - open the XCode project file and build it


Troubleshooting:
----------------

  - OSX workspaces are not updated too frequently, so same files may be missing.
