James Joplin, alias jayjay (rjoplin@webzone.net)
for all his invaluable help and encouragement with DevIL.

Edouard Gomez for his invaluable help.

All the #flipCode gang for their support.

All my friends at uni for their support.

SoftImage .pic support based off of code obtained from
http://www.swin.edu.au/astronomy/pbourke/dataformats/

TestPic, used in TestIL
http://www.paintlib.de/paintlib/testpic.zip

Png Test Images
http://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/pngsuite.html

John Villar (john.villar@eliaschev.com) for making the suggestion of not
letting the user use ILimage structs but instead binding images like OpenGL.
He also made a suggestion on how to load luminance .jpg images, along with
other suggestions.

http://www.opengl.org/Coding/KilgardTechniques/oglpitfall/oglpitfall.html
section 6 for the values the NTSC uses, so I could convert from coloured
images to luminance values.

Kodak Photo CD code from the .pcd link on http://www.wotsit.org.

Foper (foper@hotmail.com) from #flipCode for supplying the excellent
flipcode.jpg in testil\in. The original can be found at

Lightman (cdthompson@home.net) from #flipCode for restructuring the project
into /bin, /obj, etc.

Alexander Blach (alexander@abee.de) from #flipCode for creating the Delphi
headers and test app.  He figured out that we needed to use .def files to
prevent name decoration of the dlls.  He has contributed multiple ideas and
found flaws.  Alexander also created a lovely documentation database to help
with documenting DevIL.

Randy Heit for finding problems in my Doom texture code.

Oliver Kurowski (oliver.kurowski@gmx.de) for locating a bug in ilut's
DllMain() and another very harmful bug with ilDeleteImages().

found at http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/edf/
for many filters in DevIL.

SGI's "Graphica Obscura" site at http://www.sgi.com/grafica/matrix/index.html
for several filters in DevIL.

iluEdgeDetectS() and iluEdgeDetectP().

DJ Luminescent (luminescent@uswest.net) for finding a couple of bugs in the
.bmp-loading code and diligently beta testing.

Lionel Brits, alias Zaewo from #flipCode for slapping me around and telling
me how Microsoft does their .bmp padding.  He then wrote most of the
iluEqualize() code from the base code on
http://www.manning.com/Kabir/Files.html .

Joel Wilsson, alias Siigron (siigron@hotmail.com) for pointing-out several
design flaws that I (Denton) had introduced and posing very useful
suggestions.

my endless drivel about DevIL.

Perlin Noise site http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm

for explaining bilinear interpolation to me.

resource-loading code for ilutLoadResource and helping with the Windows
clipboard functions.

Strumpf from #flipCode for writing a really good DirectDraw class for me to
use in the DDraw test, which is based off of his test, too.

NullSoft (http://www.nullsoft.com), for their SuperPiMP installer.  It is
extremely easy to learn to use and very powerful.

Serun from #flipCode for noticing that Quake2 .pcx files sometimes don't have
the checksum byte for palette'd .pcx files.

Conor Stokes, aka DirtyPunk from #flipCode for helping explain several things
to me.

Half-Life model viewer sources (at http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/)
for specs for the Half-Life model format.

several functions.

Roman Podobedov (romka@ut.ee) of Romka Graphics (http://romka.demonews.com)
for his colour quantization sources, which he was kind enough to let me use.

Pcx document on http://www.wotsit.org for .pcx saving code.

http://www-classic.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/volume_III/Issue2.html#Insight
