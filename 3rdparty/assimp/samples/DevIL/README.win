Where do I find the project files ?
-----------------------------------------

MSVC++ projects are in DevIL\projects\vc8 and DevIL\projects\vc9.
If compiling with Cygwin or MinGW, use the instructions in README.unix.


The IL_NO_XXX #define's:
------------------------

A user can recompile this library without complete image support in it.  For
example, if your project does not use .jpg files, you can uncomment
#define IL_NO_JPG at the top of il/il.h, recompile the library, and no .jpg
support will be added, meaning quicker compiles and a smaller library.


The ILUT_USE_XXX #define's:
---------------------------

To disable support for a specific API, edit IL/ilut.h and comment the
corresponding #define.  Per example, to disable OpenGL functions support,
 add // in front of the line that reads:

#define ILUT_USE_OPENGL


Libraries needed to compile DevIL* :
-----------------------------------

Libraries.txt (included with the DevIL distribution) lists all libraries needed
to properly compile DevIL.

Precompiled versions and sources of all libraries needed to compile DevIL are
available at http://openil.sourceforge.net/libs/LibCompiled.zip and
http://openil.sourceforge.net/libs/LibSrc.zip , respectively.


Installation:
-------------

Just unzip and compile other libs included if needed.

Please also refer to MSVC++.txt for further instructions if you are using
Microsoft Visual C++.
