/* OpenGL ES 3 Extensions
 *
 * After an OES extension's interactions with OpenGl ES 3.0 have been documented,
 * its tokens and function definitions should be added to this file in a manner
 * that does not conflict with glext2.h or gl3.h.
 *
 * Tokens and function definitions for extensions that have become standard
 * features in OpenGL ES 3.0 will not be added to this file.
 *
 * Applications using OpenGL-ES-2-only extensions should include gl2ext.h
