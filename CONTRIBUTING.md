## How to contribute?

Everyone is welcome to contribute to bgfx by submitting bug reports, testing on
different platforms, writing examples (see [Help Needed](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+needed%22)
for ideas), improving documentation, profiling and optimizing, helping
newcomers, telling others about bgfx, etc.

If you have just quick oneliner question it's prefereable to ask it at chat
https://discord.gg/9eMbv7J instead opening new issue.

## Submitting bugs

Unless bug is trivial, and easy to explain and understand, the fastest way to
fix bug is to get repro case. In most of cases it's enough to modify existing
example (with minimal number of changes) and reproduce bug there.
