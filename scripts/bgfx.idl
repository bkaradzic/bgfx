---
--- @remarks
---   1. Uniform names are unique. It's valid to call `bgfx::createUniform`
---      multiple times with the same uniform name. The library will always
---      return the same handle, but the handle reference count will be
---      incremented. This means that the same number of `bgfx::destroyUniform`
---      must be called to properly destroy the uniform.
---
---   2. Predefined uniforms (declared in `bgfx_shader.sh`):
---      - `u_viewRect vec4(x, y, width, height)` - view rectangle for current
---        view, in pixels.
---      - `u_viewTexel vec4(1.0/width, 1.0/height, undef, undef)` - inverse
---        width and height
---      - `u_view mat4` - view matrix

---      - `u_proj mat4` - projection matrix
---      - `u_invProj mat4` - inverted projection matrix
